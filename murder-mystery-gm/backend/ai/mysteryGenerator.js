  let prompt = `You are an expert mystery writer. Your task is to generate a fully playable murder mystery scenario for a party game.
Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown formatting, no preamble, no explanation. Just the raw JSON object.

The output MUST match this exact schema style and depth:

${KHOON_KI_BARAAT_EXAMPLE}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. "player_count" MUST be exactly ${playerCount}.
2. The "players" array MUST contain exactly ${playerCount} characters.
3. EXACTLY ONE player in the "players" array must have "is_murderer": true. All others must be false.
4. Every character MUST have at least one relationship to another named character in the "players" array.
5. The "character" field in any relationship MUST exactly match the "character_name" of someone else in the generated cast. Do not invent NPC names for relationships.
6. The difference between "alibi_claimed" and "true_whereabouts" is vital, especially for the murderer.
7. You MUST generate between 5 and 8 clues in the "clues" array. Each clue needs an "id", "description", and an array of 3-5 "trigger_keywords".

RULES FOR EXCELLENCE:
- The story must be fair and solvable.
- All player motives and secrets must be unique.
- Clues should gradually point toward the truth.
- Avoid contradictions.
- Make it atmospheric and engaging.

IMPORTANT: The example above has 5 players, but you MUST generate exactly ${playerCount} players. 
Create a completely ORIGINAL mystery — do NOT copy the example story or characters. 
The setting for THIS mystery MUST be: ${randomTheme}
Every relationship "character" field must reference a character_name that exists in YOUR generated players array.
